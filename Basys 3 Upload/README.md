The Runge Gutta Algorithm is widely used to solve Ordinary Diferential Equations (ODE). This method is a popular scheme for solving initial value problems because it
has a fast rate of convergence and is relatively easy to program.

A typical Runge Gutta Algorithm taken from the book "Fundamentals of Differential Equations 8th ed" is shown below:
